Descriptions of the included add-ons

Blur
Opens a window that allows you to adjust the blurriness of the image with a slider. The blur is reflected on the image when you let go of the slider.

Brightness
Opens a window that allows you to adjust the brightness of the image with a slider. The change in brightness is reflected on the image right when you move the slider.

Color Balance
Opens a window that has three sliders for controlling the amount of red, green and blue color in the image. The change in color-balance is reflected in the image at the moment you move the sliders.

Contrast
Opens a window that has a slider for adjusting the contrast of the image. The change in contrst is reflected in the image right away.

Stretch Histogram
Improves the contrast of the image by stretcing its histogram to maximum possible length. If the image contains pure black and pure white this operation will do nothing.

Dispersion
Changes the pixels positions in the image randomly a little bit to create a "dispersed" look.

Emboss
Creates an emboss effect on the image.

Greyscale
Converts the image into greyscale.

Halftone
Creates a halftone-pattern on the image. The foreground-color is used to color the dark parts and the background-color is used to color the light parts.

Negative
Creates a negative image of the picture by inverting every color. The inversion is done in RGB-color-space

Oil
Creates a pattern on the image that tries to simulate the effect of painting the image with brush strokes.

Saturation
Opens a window that contains a slider for controlling the saturation of the image. The effect is reflected on the image right when the slider is moved.

Twirl
Makes a twirl-effect on the image. Opens a window with two sliders for controlling the size and the direction of the twirl. The center for the twirl can be set by clicking on the image and dragging around.

Wave
Creates a circular wave effect on the image. Opens a window that controls sliders for controlling the length and the strength of the wave. The wave center can be adjusted by clicking on the image with the mouse and dragging around.

PerlinWood
Creates a wood-like texture over the image.
